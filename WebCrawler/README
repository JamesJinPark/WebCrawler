Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')

  My XPath engine has a servlet that shows a website at /servlet/XPath where 
  users can enter XPaths and a URL to retrieve a XML document.  The servlet 
  can successfully retrieve a XML document and parse it into a DOM document. 

  No JUnit tests.  

  Currently, my XPath engine cannot do a proper recursive descent when descending
  the DOM document.  While my XPath engine can validate each XPath, when the XPath
  engine traverses the DOM document, it can only find the correct node if the correct
  node is the first one encountered or is a descendant of the first node encountered.

  For example, if the DOM document has three children that is named "item", and 
  the XPath is /foo/bar/item[text()="Example"], then my XPath engine will only 
  find the text(), "Example", if the text() is a child of the first "item" node. 

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  No.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  To enter multiple XPaths in the UI, the user must separate them with two colons 
  with spaces before and after.  For example:

  /foo/bar :: /moreFoo/moreBar :: /evenMoreFoo[evenMoreBar]
