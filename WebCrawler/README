Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')

    My XPath engine has a servlet that shows a website at /servlet/XPath where 
    users can enter XPaths and a URL to retrieve a XML document.  The servlet 
    can successfully retrieve a XML document and parse it into a DOM document. 

  JUnit tests for Database class wrapper. 

    Currently, my XPath engine cannot do a proper recursive descent when descending
    the DOM document.  While my XPath engine can validate each XPath, when the XPath
    engine traverses the DOM document, it can only find the correct node if the correct
    node is the first one encountered or is a descendant of the first node encountered.

    For example, if the DOM document has three children that is named "item", and 
    the XPath is /foo/bar/item[text()="Example"], then my XPath engine will only 
    find the text(), "Example", if the text() is a child of the first "item" node.

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  No.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  To enter multiple XPaths in the UI, the user must separate them with two colons 
  with spaces before and after.  For example:

  /foo/bar :: /moreFoo/moreBar :: /evenMoreFoo[evenMoreBar]

  The Berkeley database store that I used in my crawler is at:
